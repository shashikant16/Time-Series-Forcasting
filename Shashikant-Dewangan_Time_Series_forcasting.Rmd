QUESTION

* Perform a time series analysis on "Airpassenger" data. This data is available to you by default in R.

* AirPassproach the problem from a professional angle and try to gather as many information about the
dataset as possible from you analysis.

* Try to forecast the dataset for 2 more years after the datasets stops providing the information.



ANSWER

ABOUT DATASET - Monthly totals of international airline passengers between 1949 to 1960.

LOAD AND PLOT

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
AirPass <- AirPassengers

# TIME SERIES PLOT OF AIRPASSENGERS DATASET
plot(AirPass, ylab="Passengers (1000s)", type="o", pch =20)

# INFERENCE - Seasonality AirPasspears to increase with the general trend suggesting a multiplicative model rather than an additive model.

# DECOMPOSING THE DATA AND PLOT
AirPass.decompM <- decompose(AirPass, type = "multiplicative")
plot(AirPass.decompM)

# MODEL FITTING
# TREND COMPONENT - Inspecting the trend component in the decomposition plot suggests that the relationship is linear, thus fitting a linear model.
t <- seq(1, 144, 1)
modelTrend <- lm(formula = AirPass.decompM$trend ~ t)
predT <- predict.lm(modelTrend, newdata = data.frame(t))

plot(AirPass.decompM$trend[7:138] ~ t[7:138], ylab="T(t)", xlab="t",
     type="p", pch=20, main = "Trend Component: Modelled vs Observed")
lines(predT, col="red")

summary(modelTrend)

#Therefore, the relationship between trend and time can be expressed as:
#T(t)=2.667t+84.648T(t)=2.667t+84.648
#And so for 1961 (time 145 to 156 inc.), the trend component (T) is:

Data1961 <- data.frame("T" = 2.667*seq(145, 156, 1) + 84.648, S=rep(0,12), e=rep(0,12),
                       row.names = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "AirPassr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))
Data1961

# And so for 1962 (time 157 to 168 inc.), the trend component (T) is:
Data1962 <- data.frame("T" = 2.667*seq(157, 168, 1) + 84.648, S=rep(0,12), e=rep(0,12),
                       row.names = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "AirPassr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))
Data1962

#SEASONAL COMPONENT -Inspecting the seasonal (S) component of the decomposition reveals:

AirPass.decompM$seasonal

#Thus the seasonal (S) component to the new 1961 and 1962 dataset is:

Data1961$S <- unique(AirPass.decompM$seasonal)
Data1961

Data1962$S <- unique(AirPass.decompM$seasonal)
Data1962

#Random Error Component
#Ploting the density estimation of the random error (e) component of the decomposition shows an AirPassproximate normal distribution:

plot(density(AirPass.decompM$random[7:138]),
             main="Random Error") #Values 1:6 & 139:44 are NA

#BootstrAirPassping the mean statistic of the random error would produce an accurate AirPassproximation of the population mean of the randon error. However, I believe this is too costly for the reward it gives and thus I shall assume the population mean of the random error is:

mean(AirPass.decompM$random[7:138])
## [1] 0.9982357
#which is 1.

#Thus the decomposed dataset for 1961 and 1962 is:

Data1961$e <- 1
Data1961

Data1962$e <- 1
Data1962

#Predictions (1961)
#For my 1961 3-point estimates for each month, I assume that all variation is due to the random error (for simplicity) and so taking the standard deviation of the random error distribution gives:

sd_error <- sd(AirPass.decompM$random[7:138])
sd_error

#And so the 3-point esitmates (Realistic, Optimistic, Pessimistic) for the predictions is simply the expected prediction (T???S???eT???S???e), and 95% CI interval either way using the standard deviation of the random error (95% CI = 1.95???sd1.95???sd).

Data1961$R <- Data1961$T * Data1961$S * Data1961$e                  #Realistic Estimation
Data1961$O <- Data1961$T * Data1961$S * (Data1961$e+1.95*sd_error)  #Optimistic Estimation
